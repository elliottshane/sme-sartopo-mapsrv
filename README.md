# sme-sartopo-mapsrv
small node server for setting gps markers on sartopo-offline

This node server accepts http posts and then uses the sartopo api to set a marker on a given map.  For now, this functions with sartopo offline only.  I am workingon making it work with sartopo.com.

to use with sartopo offline:

1. clone the repository.
2. run with node . 

you should see:

Sartopo-offline map server running on *:4567

From your application, send a web post to http://your.server.name:4567/point

with json formatted like:

            { logId: '',
            team: '', //data used for marker label (if you pass a number only, it will add "Team-" to the number.)
            lat: 34.00989856554934,
            lng: -116.94253665575694,
            index: 3, //used by my app and for marker label if team is null
            mapId: 'XXXX' } //the sartopo mapID



# Sartopo.com

I am working on this working with sartopo.com.  From what I understand, I need to send the same info from above with:

1. id (Code paramaer described below)
2. expires (Time, in milliseconds, after which you want this request to become invalid; two minutes in the future is a good guideline.  This does not refer to the date of your subscription expiration.)
3. signature (a signature).  The signature is a hash of data as described below:


Signature:

The signature is a HMAC-SHA256 hash of the data below.  this signatre is compared on sartopo.com and if it is the same, adds the marker to the identified mapID.  

 data hashed in signature:

 1. method.  The method should be POST
 2. uri.  the uri is the url of the the map api without the hostname. /api/v1/map/{mapID}/Marker
 3. expires. explained above.
 4. payload.  the geo-json of the point.

 the signature is hashed by a key.  the key is btained with the code (id) desribed below. 
 
 in the format:
        
        method + " " + uri + "\n" + expires + "\n" + payload

Generating the signature. 

In Java:
Some java Matt provided that generates the signature:


        private static byte[] HmacSHA256(String data, byte[] key) throws Exception  {
            String algorithm="HmacSHA256";
            Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(algorithm);
            mac.init(new SecretKeySpec(key, algorithm));
            return mac.doFinal(data.getBytes("UTF8"));
        }

        byte[] bytes = HmacSHA256(method + " " + uri + "\n" + expires + "\n" + (payload == null ? "" : payload), Base64.decode(key));
        return Base64.encode(bytes);

I have a java implementation of this from Matt's code in this repository under java/hmac2.  If you manually change:

                String method = "POST";
		String uri = "/api/v1/map/{mapId}/Marker";
		String payload = "";
		String expires = "";
		String id = "";  // Code Parameter described below.


In JsvaScript:
Here is what I have implemented to generatethe signature and use in this node app. The variables are set in the config.js file.

        expires: {Unix Timestamp}, //time in milliseconds after which this request will be invalid
        key64: "", //Key Parameter
        id: "", //Code Parameter


        let data = "POST" + " " + uri + "\n" + expires + "\n" + (payload == null ? "" : payload);
        let key = new Buffer(key64, 'base64');
        var hash = crypto.createHmac('SHA256', key).update(data).digest('base64');

In Python (from github.com/ncssar/sartopo_python) where 'j' is the json payload:
```
            params={}
            params["json"]=json.dumps(j)
            if "sartopo.com" in self.domainAndPort.lower():
                self.expires=int(time.time()*1000)+120000 # 2 minutes from current time, in milliseconds
                data="POST "+mid+apiUrlEnd+"\n"+str(self.expires)+"\n"+json.dumps(j)
                print("pre-hashed data:"+data)                
                token=hmac.new(base64.b64decode(self.key),data.encode(),'sha256').digest()
                token=base64.b64encode(token).decode()
                print("hashed data:"+str(token))
                params["id"]=self.id
                params["expires"]=self.expires
                params["signature"]=token
            print("SENDING POST to '"+url+"':")
            print(json.dumps(params,indent=3))
            r=self.s.post(url,data=params,timeout=2)
```

 Update, I can now post to sartopo.com with signature.  I will add some API endpoints for my app and others soon. For now,the following is implemented:

at the console you can hit the following letters to test posting to sartopo.com:

* t = test posing with signature to sartopo.com
* m = post without signature, this I use to verify the geojson is correct and I post to sartopo offline. 
* x = jsut give you the hash for comparison. 

PHP

I have added a php example under php/map.php below quick snipit

          $key = base64_decode($key64);
          $payload = json_encode($point);
          $data = "POST" ." " . $uri ."\n". $expires . "\n" . $payload;
          $token = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', $data ,$key,true));





# Code.

Above I reference a Code and Key pair for use in generating the required signature for posting to sartop.com.  This info can be obtained as follows:

1. login into your sartopo account. 
2. click on this url [sartopo.com app activation](https://sartopo.com/app/activate/offline?redirect=localhost)
3. enable the developer console of your browser and go to the network tab. 
4. check the checkbox and click on syn account. 
5. you will notice a failed post with a code in it, copy the code.
6. replace your_code in the following url and paste into the browser. sartopo.com/api/v1/activate?code=your_code
7. you should get a page that looks like the following:

		{
		  "code": "XXXXXXXXXXX",
		  "account": {
		    "id": "XXXXXX",
		    "type": "Feature",
		    "properties": {
		      "subscriptionExpires": 1554760038,
		      "subscriptionType": "pro-1",
		      "subscriptionRenew": true,
		      "subscriptionStatus": "active",
		      "title": "......@sbsar",
		      "class": "UserAccount",
		      "updated": 1554760038,
		      "email": "......@sbsar.org"
		    }
		  },
		  "key": "xXXXXxXXXXXXXXXxxxXXXXxXxXXXXXXXXXXXX="
		}

the id is the value of code and ky is the value of key.

I have it running on my little sartopo offline box with https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2
